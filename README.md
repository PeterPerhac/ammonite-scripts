# Ammonite Scripts

If I come up with any that I'd like to share, I'll add them to here.

## scripts

* **ppm**

    run the script like so: `amm Colors.ppm.scala image.ppm` and Ammonite will produce a ppm-formatted image called `image.ppm`. You can read more about the [PPM image format here](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html). Open the newly generated ppm file `open myfilename.ppm`. The output looks like this (only bigger) ![colors](assets/images/img.png)

* **other**
